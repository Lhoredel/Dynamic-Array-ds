# Dynamic-Array-ds
This code implements the Dynamic Array data structure that stores sequences and processes two types of queries. For type 1 queries, it appends elements to sequences using a hash function based on XOR and modulo operations. For type 2 queries, it retrieves values from sequences, updates the lastAnswer variable, and collects results while maintaining the dynamic array's state.
